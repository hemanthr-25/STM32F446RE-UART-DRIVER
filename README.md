STM32F446RE UART Driver Development Welcome to the UART driver development project for the STM32F446RE microcontroller.
This project demonstrates low-level driver development for the UART peripheral without using any HAL libraries, directly accessing STM32 registers.

There is a source code in this repo used for demanstrating the UART DRIVER

usart_tx : To test the UART TX working
